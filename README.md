# text-augmentor

## -=Project Description=-

This challenge focused on producing a Progressive Web Application (PWA). The application itself is a text editor that utilizes cache, localStorage, and indexDB to store vital information. Some specific topics learned during the production include service workers, indexdb, and webpack plugins. This project utilized the client-server folder structure for organization and exports a 'dist' build for production.

## -=Installation=-

Before running the program, install the root and client-server _npm dependencies_ with:

<div style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); vertical-align: middle; padding:10px 20px; border-radius: 10px">
npm i AND npm run install
</div>

## -=Usage=-

This application is a text editor that meets the requirements of a PWA. It contains data persistence techniques to serve as redundancies if any code is not supported on the user's browser. The app can also function offline as well as be installed as an actual application on your device.

To run the code, start the server from the command line by typing:

<div style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); vertical-align: middle; padding:10px 20px; border-radius: 10px">
npm run start
</div>

<br>
in the command line of the root directory to create a client build and to launch the server. Then navigate to localhost:3000 to interact with the application.
